# Connect-Four
A simple connect four game which I made using the pygame module in python
# NOTES:-
1. This game is free to play
2. This game was entirely developed using pygame module
3. The Artificial Intelligence code of this game i.e the code for the computers' moves was entirely taken from the Internet as it was quite difficult to implement it singlehandedly
4. I have done my best to make this game as smooth and good as possible. I acknowledge my teachers for helping me as well as the internet for sugggesting me ideas for the code
5. And finally, you are free to use any images for the game or you can refer the images i uploaded.
6. Thank you
